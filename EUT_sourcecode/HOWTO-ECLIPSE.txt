SETTING UP ECLIPSE FOR THE SAMPLE CODE

The sample code has been provided in a set of Maven projects. In order to 
get the code smoothly into your Eclipse IDE, you need to perform the 
following steps:

1. Generate the Eclipse project files

  The Eclipse project files (.project and .classpath) are system-specific
  and not included out of the box. You can let Maven generate those files 
  for you by executing the following command in the console/command prompt 
  from the root directory, next to a file called "pom.xml": 

  $ mvn eclipse:eclipse

2. Generate the M2_REPO classpath variable

  The Maven Eclipse plugin generates the .classpath file with 
  references to an Eclipse classpath variable named "M2_REPO". That variable
  doesn't exist in Eclipse by default so you'll need to create it for your
  Eclipse workspace (if you haven't already). Execute the following command, 
  telling Maven the location of your Eclipse workspace directory:

  $ mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo

3. Import the modules as separate projects 

  The sample code is organized as one big multi-module Maven project, which 
  means that we'll have one Eclipse project per module (chapter). In order to 
  import the modules as regular Java projects into Eclipse, perform these 
  steps in Eclipse:

  1. Import > Existing Projects into Workspace
  2. Type in the sample code package's root directory and click "Refresh"
  3. Select all listed projects and click "Finish"
